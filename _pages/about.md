I am a PhD candidate in the [Numerical Analysis group](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/applied-mathematics/numerical-analysis) of the [Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics (DIAM)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/applied-mathematics), [Faculty Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/) at the [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/).

My main research area is **numerical methods for partial differential equations**, more specifically domain decomposition and multiscale methods for the **simulation of fluid flow in porous media**. I am interested in approaches to enable high performance large scale numerical simulations involving challenging scenarios, e.g. highly heterogeneous media and complex geometries.
